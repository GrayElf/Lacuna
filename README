Lemming Scripts.  Using the GLC one for any updates to the library.
Scripts that aren't quite mature enough to be in the examples will be here.
I also don't follow the convention strictly.  I prefer --config lacuna.yml and
my data directory lives below my active directory.
lacuna --
     |--- bin   (All scripts)
     |--- data  (data shared between servers)
     |--- lib   (GLC lib)
     |--- norway_us1  (server empire)
                   |--- data (server specific data such as stars.db)
     |--- test_empire_pt
                   |--- data (server specific data such as stars.db)
     |--- tour_empire_us2
                   |--- data (server specific data such as stars.db)
