Lemming Scripts.  These work with the GLC library from: https://github.com/tsee/Games-Lacuna-Client

Scripts that aren't quite mature enough to be in the examples at GLC will be here.
I also don't follow the convention strictly.  I prefer --config lacuna.yml and
my data directory lives below my active directory.
